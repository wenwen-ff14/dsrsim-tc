"""Parse an FFXIV ACT/IINACT network log and print pulls in a given territory.

WARNING: parser is 100% vibe-coded, code is bad but it works

Usage:
    python parser.py <log_path> [<territory_id_decimal>]

Example:
    python parser.py ..\\logs\\Network_30108_20260504_TOP.log 1122

Run with just the log path (no territory id) to list every encounter — i.e.
each distinct territory that saw combat — so you can pick a territory id to
drill into.

Territory IDs are decimal (1122 = TOP = 0x462). The log stores them in hex
on `01|` (ChangeZone) lines.

A "pull" is a combat segment that occurred while the local player was in the
selected territory. Combat boundaries come from `260|` (InCombat) lines: the
game-combat flag (field 3, inGameCombat) going 0->1 marks combat start, 1->0
marks combat end. (We deliberately ignore field 2, inACTCombat — ACT bridges a
quick wipe-and-repull with its out-of-combat grace timeout, which would merge
two real pulls into one and count the dead time between them.) A pull
is treated as a clear iff director subcommand 0x40000003 appears inside the
combat window (it fires once per duty completion, just before combat-end);
every other pull is a wipe.

Some FFXIV_ACT_Plugin captures emit no `260|` lines at all. When the log has
none, pull detection falls back to the duty director's `33|` ActorControl
codes: 0x40000001 (commence) starts a pull, 0x40000005/0x40000006 (wipe
fadeout) or 0x40000003 (clear) ends it, and the first hostile NPC ability
re-opens combat after a wipe (the reset is not commence-marked).

    """Build a complete C# scenario class from the given window.

    Layout:
      - One `Run_<Name>()` method per stable NPC instance; the method declares
        a local `SimEnemy? <field> = null;` (or `SimEventObject? <field>` for
        Type|7 visual-only EventObjects) and registers all of that NPC's events
        through `world.Events.Add(...)`.
      - Run_InstanceEvents() for map / director events (257, 33-director, etc).
      - Run_PlayerTethers() for player-to-player tethers — events that have no
        owning NPC and so cannot live inside any per-NPC method.
      - Run_OtherDebuffs() for `26|NetworkBuff` applies and `30|NetworkBuffRemove`
        removals whose source is the duty director (`E0000000`) and that aren't
        already consumed as the debuff backing a player tether. Applies emit
        `AddStatus`; removals emit `RemoveStatus`. Sorted by timestamp.
      - A nested static `Constants` class collects every BNpc base/name id,
        spell id, status id, tether id, and timeline id encountered, with
        sanitised PascalCase names sourced from the log itself.

    Every emitted `world.Events.Add(...)` is preceded by a `// <raw packet>`
    comment line; opcodes without an API mapping fall through to a bare
    comment with no code line.

    Events before `begin_rel` keep their negative scenario timestamp so the
    reader can see when they actually fired in the recording; the
    `EventScheduler` internally clamps negatives to 0, so they all fire at
    scenario start, which matches the recorded ordering."""
