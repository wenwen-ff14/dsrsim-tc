// IDs and tunables for Celestriad. Sourced from Network_30207_20260811.log (pull #16,
// territory 1363, via tools/parser.py ... 1363 16 <window> -x), the deepest replay-confirmed
// Celestriad attempt available; ESTIMATE markers below flag values that pull never reached.
//
// Non-obvious structural facts:
// - FireIII/BlizzardIII/ThunderIII are single-target casts (Kefka onto a specific player), not
//   ground telegraphs. Reused here for both the initial debuff (silent, no cast) and the tower
//   resolve VFX (cast onto an invisible marker at the tower, so it animates).
// - The towers are native EventObjects, not cast omens: confirmed via the replay's spawn
//   packets at radius 10 from arena centre, 40 degrees apart, in three contiguous per-element
//   blocks (not interleaved): 20/60/100, 140/180/220, 260/300/340 degrees.
// - All 9 towers spawn once and persist for the whole mechanic; each set just toggles its 4
//   active towers between DormantState (resting look, ring included) and ActiveState (lit).
// - Only two Catastrophic Choice casts happen in total, not one per set: the first governs set
//   0's resolution, the second governs set 2's; set 1 has none and resolves independently
//   between them.
// - Aero (green) is safe away from the boss; Earth (brown) is safe toward the boss.
//
// Still unverified: which raw action id (CatastrophicChoiceAero/Earth) is actually the green
// vs. the brown telegraph.
//
// Nested types are prefixed Celestriad* (not the usual bare ActionId/StatusId) so this file's
// `using static` can coexist with UmadConstants': both would otherwise declare a same-named
// nested class, which is ambiguous under two simultaneous `using static` imports.
