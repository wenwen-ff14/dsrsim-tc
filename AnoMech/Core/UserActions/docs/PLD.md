## Traits
No trait gaps — the enhancement traits (Enhanced Fight or Flight, Divine Magic Mastery, Enhanced Prominence, Sword Oath, Enhanced Requiescat, Enhanced Blade of Valor) fold into their action rows; the rest are potency or native upgrades (➖).

## Role actions
Rampart, Low Blow, Provoke, Interject, Reprisal, Arm's Length, Shirk — all ➖.

## Not simulated
- **Holy Spirit / Holy Circle double-consume.** Each removes Divine Might (2673) and decrements a Requiescat (1368) stack in the same cast; in-game Divine Might is prioritized and spent alone, so a stack can be burned one cast early.
- **Confiteor route step values unconfirmed in-game.** The route is backed by the `PldConfiteorStep` gauge (Confiteor +1, Blade of Faith +1, Blade of Truth +1, Blade of Valor −3, Max 3) plus a 30s decay reset, but whether these exact step values drive `GetAdjustedActionId` (Confiteor→Faith→Truth→Valor swap) is not verified in-game.
- **Oath Gauge neither generated nor spent.** No gauge generation (Oath Mastery's +5/auto-attack isn't simulated) and cost type 41 is absent from `CostGauges`, so Sheltron / Holy Sheltron / Intervention / Cover can't be afforded in-sim. Mitigation-only impact.
