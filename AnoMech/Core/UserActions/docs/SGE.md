## Traits
| Trait | Status | Note |
|-------|:------:|------|
| Addersting | ⚠️ | Gain-on-barrier-absorb (Max 3) — the source of the un-generated Addersting gauge; not simulated. |

## Role actions
Repose, Esuna, Lucid Dreaming, Surecast, Rescue — ➖. Swiftcast ✅ (167 → next spell instant).

## Not simulated
- **Toxikon / Toxikon II (24304 / 24316)** — Addersting spend is wired (`CostGauges[69]`) but the gauge is never generated in-sim; its only source is a fully-absorbed barrier, and the sim has no incoming damage, so it stays at 0 and both actions are permanently unusable.
- **Eukrasia gauge byte (SageGauge 0x0C)** — only the status (2606) is set, not the byte. The on-gauge Eukrasia indicator won't light, and if `GetAdjustedActionId` keys the augmented-spell swaps (Dosis III / Diagnosis / Prognosis → Eukrasian) on the gauge byte rather than the status, the upgraded spells won't surface. Needs an in-game check; if gauge-keyed, also write the byte.
