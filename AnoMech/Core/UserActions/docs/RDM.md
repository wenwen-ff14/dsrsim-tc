## Traits
| Trait | Status | Note |
|-------|:------:|------|
| Dualcast | ⚠️ | Buff granted on cast completion; consumed by any non-ability action (Acceleration-reduced casts excepted). Cast isn't actually made instant (client ignores the granted status). |

## Role actions
Addle, Sleep, Lucid Dreaming, Surecast — ➖. Swiftcast ✅ (167 → next spell instant; priority Acceleration → Dualcast → Swiftcast).

## Not simulated
- **Dualcast cast-time reduction** — the Dualcast buff is granted on cast completion and consumed by the next spell, but that spell isn't actually made instant: the client honours a granted Swiftcast/Acceleration status for cast time but not a granted Dualcast, and driving the cast directly glitched the UI.
- **Unbalanced mana** — White/Black clamp independently; the |White − Black| > 30 penalty (lower colour generates at half rate) and crystal recolour are unmodelled (`// TODO`).
- **Magicked Swordplay free-cast** — under Magicked Swordplay enchanted melee should cost a stack instead of mana; the generic cost path always subtracts White/Black mana, so enchanted melee never becomes free.
- **Conditional proc guarantees** — procs roll their flat chance (Verthunder III/Veraero III/Impact 50%, Verflare/Verholy 20%) even where the game guarantees 100%: while Acceleration is up, and (for Verflare/Verholy) when the opposite mana colour is higher.
- **Base Verthunder/Veraero (7505/7507)** — grant only the proc, not their +6 mana (moot at 100; the III forms are correct).
