// One end of a SimTether. An end is both the *spec* (how the scenario declares
// it) and the *behaviour* (how it resolves to a live character each tick). The
// resolve is intentionally pure — SimTether owns the per-tick state (its current
// source/target) and hands each end its own current value (`self`) plus the
// opposite end (`other`). That keeps the End objects immutable and freely
// reusable: a PassableEnd holds only its immutable initial seed, not a mutable
// "who holds it now" field.
//
// Two kinds:
//   - FixedEnd       — a constant character (the anchor). At the SimWorld.Tether
//                      API a fixed end is written as a raw SimCharacter; FixedEnd
//                      is the internal wrapper the overloads build around it.
//   - DynamicEnd     — migrates each tick relative to the *other* end:
//       · PassableEnd        — the closest member intercepting the beam toward
//                              the anchor takes it over.
//       · FarthestPlayerEnd  — the party member farthest from the anchor.
//
// Dynamic ends are defined relative to a stable reference, so a tether must have
// at least one fixed end. That invariant is enforced at the call site by the
// SimWorld.Tether overload set (a fixed end is a SimCharacter, a dynamic end is a
// DynamicEnd) — a tether with two dynamic ends matches no overload and simply
// doesn't compile, no runtime guard needed.
//
// `from` hosts the channeling VFX (drawn from `from` toward `to`), so the choice
// of which end is dynamic — and the argument order — together pick both the
// passable direction and the visual direction.
public interface ITetherEnd
{
    // self  = this end's current character (null on the first, seeding resolve).
    // other = the opposite end's current character (the reference for migration).
    SimCharacter? Resolve(SimCharacter? self, SimCharacter? other, TetherContext ctx);
}

// channeling id (to skip members already holding a parallel tether of the same id).
