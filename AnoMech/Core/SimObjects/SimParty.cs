// SimPartyNpc (spawned doppel) or the SimPlayer (the player's own role) — both
// ISimPartyMember. Slots are stored/returned as SimCharacter so they thread
// straight into the character-typed engine APIs (world.Tether, AddStatus, ...);
// the party-slot facets (Role, Knockback) are reached by casting to
// ISimPartyMember.
//
// HUD mirroring is owned by SimWorld (not SimParty) — see SimWorld.partyHud —
// so the addon-lifecycle listener has the same lifespan as the plugin and the
// SimParty.Empty sentinel doesn't accidentally register one at static init.
