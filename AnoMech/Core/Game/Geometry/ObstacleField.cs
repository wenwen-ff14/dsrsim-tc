// A scenario's "geometry": the set of obstacles party bots steer around while
// moving. The special container that fully owns both the obstacle list and the
// steering algorithm — SimWorld just holds one instance and hands it to each
// party doppel; it has no obstacle logic of its own.
//
// Empty by default, so with no obstacles every bot moves in a straight line
// (Steer returns the desired direction unchanged). Scenarios mutate the field
// over their event timeline via Add / Remove / Clear; it is wiped on world
// teardown. Non-bot characters (bosses, the player) keep ObstacleField.Empty and
// are never affected.
//
// Steering is reactive and per-frame, not a planned path: it naturally copes
// with obstacles that appear, drift, or vanish mid-move, and is intentionally
// simple (single dominant obstacle per frame) rather than globally optimal —
// good enough for sparse convex shapes, which is all this needs to be.
